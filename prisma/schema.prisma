Abstract—Urbanization has strengthened the Urban Heat Is- land (UHI) phenomenon with the resulting temperature, energy expenditure, and related negative health conditions in urbanized cities. Historical methods of environment monitoring tend not to have appropriate spatial resolution required for capturing urban microclimates across cities such as Chennai in India. In this paper, a low-budget IoT-supported web-based platform with capabilities for urban microclimate sensing and climate adaptation support decision making in real-time is proposed. The system incorporates an array of low-cost IoT sensors installed throughout different urban microenvironments to constantly monitor parameters like temperature, humidity, and air quality. The data is fed to a centralized web platform that provides real-time visualization and analysis software. This allows stake- holders—urban planners, policymakers, and citizens—to make educated decisions in response to mitigating UHI impacts and promoting urban resilience. Early deployments showcase the plat- form’s effectiveness in delivering high-resolution environmental information, highlighting its potential as a useful resource for sustainable urban planning.

I.	INTRODUCTION
Urbanization has changed natural environments into urban- ized environments greatly, and in this change, Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) have developed, where urban zones are warmer than their rural environments [3]. It occurs due to increased imperviousness, lesser vegetation cover, and waste heat pro- duced by human activities. In Chennai, India, urbanization has intensified the UHI effect, with analyses showing that average maximum UHI intensity is up to 2.48°C in summer and 3.35°C in winter [3]. This strengthening also presents challenges like increased energy expenditure, worsened air quality, and negative impacts on the health of urban citizens. Conventional environmental monitoring procedures in cities predominantly depend on rare meteorological stations, which do not capture high-resolution spatial variance of microclimate conditions. This constraint impedes the implementation of focused climate adaptation and urban planning strategies. Emerging technologies in the Internet of Things (IoT) provide
 
promising directions to bridge these gaps. Using networks of inexpensive sensors, it is feasible to observe environmental metrics like temperature, humidity, and air quality at a detailed level, enabling real-time information gathering and analysis [4].
This article introduces the creation of an IoT-augmented web platform for real-time urban microclimate monitoring and climate-resilient decision support, specifically for the city of Chennai. The platform aggregates data from a network of low-cost IoT sensors strategically located in different urban microenvironments. The data are processed and visualized using a friendly web interface, offering actionable information to stakeholders such as urban planners, policymakers, and the general public to support climate resilience planning.
The main goals of this study are to:
1.	Implement and Design a Low-Cost IoT Sensor Network: Design and deploy low-cost, dependable sensor nodes that can monitor important environmental parameters of interest to urban microclimates.
2.	Create a Real-Time Data Processing and Visualization Platform: Design a web-based platform that collects sensor data, conducts real-time analysis, and displays information in a usable format for various stakeholders.
3.	Evaluate the Effectiveness of the System in Facilitating Climate-Adaptive Decision Making: Consider how the insights of the platform can be used to guide urban planning and public health interventions that help counteract the negative impacts of UHIs and increase climate resilience.
Through a focus on Chennai as a case study, this study seeks to illustrate the practicability and efficacy of utilizing IoT technologies in monitoring urban microclimates, with prospects for replication in other fast-growing regions with comparable climatic issues.
II.	LITERATURE REVIEW
The adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in urban microclimate monitoring has become a strong focus in the past few years, providing creative solutions to tackle the challenges that come with urbanization and climate change.
 
This literature review critically reviews current research and developments on IoT-based microclimate monitoring systems, including their methodologies, applications, and areas where the existing research falls short.
A.	IoT-Based Sensor Networks for Microclimate Monitoring
Some studies have aimed at the creation of IoT-based sensor networks for micro-scale monitoring of environmental param- eters. Jha et al. (2019) presented various details concerning the development of IoT-based sensor nodes for monitoring the urban microclimate, highlighting software development, pertinent methodologies, hardware modules, and platforms [1]. Rebaudo et al. (2021) also developed a low-cost IoT network to observe microclimate variables in ecosystems, assessing its application in agroecosystems in temperate and inter-tropical regions [2].
B.	Low-Cost and Low-Tech Methods
Precision instrumentation has historically been too expen- sive, and hence, large-scale microclimate monitoring has often been constrained by its high cost. To overcome this, there has been progress in the development of low-cost and low- tech methods. A paper presented a novel, low-tech device for district-level outdoor thermal comfort evaluation and UHI definition that can be used in networks to improve spatial coverage. This automatic weather station uses sensors to take readings of temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and globe temperature, providing a low-cost option for obtaining high-resolution data in metropolitan regions [4].
C.	Real-Time Data Processing and Visualization Platforms
The performance of microclimate monitoring systems is considerably improved by real-time processing and visualiza- tion functionalities. Rathore et al. (2017) have designed an IoT-based real-time urban microclimate analysis system, which merges data from multiple sensors to offer decision-making insights for stakeholders [7]. Urban planners, policymakers, and residents are able to make informed decisions focused on mitigating the effects of UHI and improving urban resilience through such platforms.
D.	Applications in Climate-Adaptive Decision Support
IoT-based microclimate monitoring systems have been uti- lized to assist climate-adaptive decision-making processes. For example, Sanhaji et al. (2024) created an IoT-based microcli- mate control optimization system for tropical greenhouses, re- acting to climate change by controlling temperature, humidity, and light intensity through monitoring [6]. Such applications illustrate the ability of IoT technologies to enable adaptive strategies to manage environmental challenges.
E.	Gaps and Future Directions
Although there has been great advancement in IoT-based monitoring of the microclimate, there are still challenges in gaining extensive deployment and integration into urban planning procedures. Data accuracy, sensor calibration, net- work stability, and user-friendly interfaces remain areas that
 
require improvement in order to achieve the full potential of these technologies. The future will require the development of standardized protocols, the increased durability of sensors, and the establishment of platforms that are usable by non-technical stakeholders.
III.	CURRENT SYSTEM
Recent urban microclimate monitoring systems that are mostly utilized for gathering environment data like temper- ature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation rely on IoT- based sensor networks. For example, ICT International’s IoT Microclimate Monitoring Station is a diverse combination of different sensors and contains communication protocols like LoRaWAN and CAT-M1/NB-IoT, offering real-time transmis- sion of data used in agriculture and hydrology [1]. In the same vein, Rebaudo et al. created an inexpensive IoT network to track microclimate parameters in ecological systems using temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors and wireless network data transmission [2]. Jha et al. also introduced an IoT-enabled urban microclimate monitoring architecture based on sensor node design, data gathering, and communication modules [3]. Benchmark Labs offers an IoT-based weather monitoring system designed for microclimate forecasting, pro- viding continuous environmental monitoring through auto- mated processes [8].
IV.	PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed system aims to enhance urban microclimate monitoring by developing a low-cost, IoT-enhanced web plat- form tailored for real-time data collection and climate-adaptive decision support in Chennai. This system deploys affordable IoT sensor nodes across diverse urban microenvironments to continuously measure parameters such as temperature, hu- midity, and air quality. The collected data is transmitted to a centralized web platform that offers real-time visualization and analysis tools, empowering stakeholders—including urban planners, policymakers, and residents—to make informed de- cisions aimed at mitigating Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects and enhancing urban resilience [2], [3], [4], [5].
A. Sensor Selection and Specifications
To simulate and propose an effective real-time microclimate monitoring system, we identified widely available, low-cost sensors suitable for deployment. Temperature and humidity were modeled using the DHT22 sensor, which provides high accuracy and low power consumption. For air quality mon- itoring, simulated data reflects outputs similar to an MQ-
135 sensor, capable of detecting various urban pollutants. Additionally, particulate matter levels (PM2.5 and PM10), critical for health-related urban analysis, were simulated based on the capabilities of sensors like PMS5003. Optional sensors, such as the BMP280 for atmospheric pressure and BH1750 for light intensity, were also considered for expanded functionality in future deployments.
The design of the platform focuses on user access, accuracy of data, and scalability for future growth. The main goals of this system are:

The proposed system distinguishes itself by offering a cost-effective, user-friendly, and scalable solution specifically designed for urban microclimate monitoring in Chennai.
V.	SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The proposed IoT-enhanced web platform for urban micro- climate monitoring is designed using a multi-layered approach to ensure real-time data acquisition, processing, and visualiza- tion. The architecture is divided into several key layers, as illustrated in Figure 1:
Figure Explanation: Figure 1 shows the layered structure of the proposed system. Starting from the left, the sensor layer collects environmental data, which is transmitted via wireless protocols in the communication layer. The data is then processed and stored in a central server, and finally, the information is visualized on a web dashboard for urban planners, policymakers, and citizens. This comprehensive ar- chitecture facilitates real-time monitoring and supports data- driven decision making for climate adaptation and urban resilience.
Sensor Layer: This layer comprises low-cost sensors such as temperature, humidity, and air quality sensors integrated with microcontrollers (e.g., the WiFi LoRa 32 V2 module). These sensors are deployed across various urban microenvi- ronments to capture real-time environmental data.
Communication Layer: Data captured by the sensors is transmitted using wireless protocols such as Wi-Fi and Lo- RaWAN. A gateway device aggregates the data and forwards it to the central server.
Data Processing and Storage Layer: In this layer, a cloud or local server aggregates, stores (e.g., in a PostgreSQL database), and processes the sensor data in real time. This layer may also include modules for data cleaning and preliminary analytics.
 

 



Visualization and Decision Support Layer: Processed data is then presented on a web-based dashboard, enabling urban planners, policymakers, and citizens to visualize trends and make informed decisions.
User/Stakeholder Layer: End users, including urban plan- ners, policymakers, and the general public, access the dash- board and utilize the insights to implement climate-adaptive strategies.
VI.	COMPARISON WITH EXISTENT SYSTEMS

VII.	SIMULATED SENSOR DATA AND EXPECTED RESULTS

As we lacked direct sensor data, we utilized historical cli- mate data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and research studies to simulate expected results for urban microclimate monitoring in Tamil Nadu. This approach gives a baseline estimate of temperature trends and the urban heat island (UHI) effect in the region [13], [14].

A.	Temperature Trends in Tamil Nadu
Historical records and forecasts reveal considerable warm- ing trends in Tamil Nadu:
Average Maximum Summer Temperatures: Research indicates that Tamil Nadu has witnessed a rise of about 1.5°C in average maximum summer temperatures since 1981 [13].
Projected Temperature Rises: Climate projections indicate that the maximum temperatures over Tamil Nadu are likely to increase by 1.0°C by the 2020s, 2.2°C by the 2050s, and 3.1°C by the 2080s, compared to the reference period of 1970–2000 [14].

B.	Urban Heat Island (UHI) Effect in Chennai
Chennai has a pronounced urban heat island effect, with city temperatures being considerably higher than in surrounding rural areas:
Temperature Disparities: Research indicates that urban zones in Chennai experience temperatures 3–4°C higher than surrounding rural regions due to increased urbanization, de- creased vegetation, and the prevalence of heat-absorbing ma- terials [15].
Impact of Urbanization: The rapid expansion of Chennai’s built-up area has intensified the UHI effect, exacerbating local climatic conditions and increasing energy consumption for cooling needs [15].
 
C.	Simulated Sensor Readings
Utilizing historical and forecasted climate information, we simulated sensor data that an actual IoT-based microclimate monitoring system would most probably record:
Temperature Sensors: Simulated sensor data reveal that daytime average temperatures in urban Chennai may be as high as 38°C during the hottest summer months, while the sur- rounding rural regions register temperatures of approximately 34°C, reflecting a UHI intensity of about 4°C [13], [15].
Humidity Sensors: Relative humidity values in urban areas are marginally lower than their rural counterparts owing to reduced vegetation and higher heat retention in urban settings [4].
Air Quality Sensors: Urban areas, particularly in Chennai, have higher levels of pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10, aligning with higher emissions from vehicles and industrial processes [7].
D.	Implications for Urban Planning
The modeled results underscore the importance of site- specific urban planning measures to counteract microclimate problems:
Green Infrastructure: Urban green cover such as parks and street tree canopy can be increased to mitigate UHI effects by shading and increasing evapotranspiration [3].
Reflective Materials: Incorporation of high-albedo building materials and cool roofs can mitigate heat absorption, reducing ambient temperatures in compact city environments [5].
Sustainable Transportation: Minimizing fossil fuel-based vehicle dependence through public transport, cycling, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure can enhance air quality and reduce emissions [6].
These simulated predictions, when integrated with real-time IoT sensor readings, can facilitate climate-adaptive decision- making and aid in formulating policies for sustainable urban planning in Tamil Nadu [13], [14], [15].
VIII.	HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
Creating a low-cost IoT-boosted web platform for real-time urban microclimate monitoring requires proper hardware and software component selection to provide system reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Based on current research and practical applications, the following are the necessary requirements:
A.	Hardware Requirements
Microcontroller Units (MCUs): Low-power MCUs are used as the primary processing units for sensor nodes that handle data collection and communication operations. For example, the WiFi LoRa 32 V2 module combines both Wi- Fi and LoRa communication features, providing a low-cost option for IoT applications [9].
Sensors: Good environmental monitoring calls for trusted sensors to sense parameters like temperature, humidity, and air quality. In Rebaudo et al.’s work, an IoT network at minimal cost was implemented to observe microclimate parameters
 
with sensors that could capture environmental readings as accurately as commercial systems [1].
Communication Modules: For long-distance data transmis- sion, modules that support protocols such as LoRaWAN are necessary. ICT International’s IoT Microclimate Monitoring Station can be integrated into new or existing LoRaWAN networks, or deployed as standalone systems utilizing CAT- M1/NB-IoT cellular connectivity, providing flexible deploy- ment options [8].
Power Supply: The provision of continuous operation of sensor nodes necessitates high-performance power solutions. The design of self-powered sensing (SPS) nodes that generate power from the surrounding environment provides a clean source of power for IoT devices in forest ecosystems [2].
Enclosures: Weather-resistant and durable enclosures shield hardware elements from the external environment, guarantee- ing consistency of operation and long-term durability. Com- ponents for the microclimate monitoring system presented by Camparim et al. were placed in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes to shield them from outdoor conditions, establishing a good low-cost solution [9].
B.	Software Requirements
Operating Systems: Small operating systems for IoT de- vices, like TinyOS or Contiki, offer only necessary functional- ities at the cost of less resource usage. They are well equipped to handle the limitations of wireless sensor networks with effective task management and communication protocols [12]. Data Storage and Processing: Having good data manage- ment systems is important for coping with the vast amount of environmental data. Rebaudo et al. employed a PostgreSQL database on a Linux server using NGINX and Node.js for data from their IoT network so that there can be proper storage and
retrieval of data [1].
Communication Protocols: Employing standardized com- munication protocols will guarantee interoperability and safe data transmission. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard, for instance, specifies the physical and medium access control layers for low-rate wireless personal area networks, widely applied in wireless sensor networks [12].
User Interface: Creating accessible web interfaces or mo- bile apps increases user experience and usability. The IoT Mi- croclimate Monitoring Station provided by ICT International provides a centralized web platform for real-time visual data and analysis, with actionable insights given to the stakeholders [8].
Security Protocols: Implementing security measures is essential to protect data integrity and prevent unauthorized access. In the IoT monitoring system for educational build- ings, secure data transmission was emphasized to ensure the reliability of the collected environmental data [6].
Through the integration of these hardware and software elements, the suggested system is designed to offer an overall solution for monitoring urban microclimates, allowing for well-informed decision-making and helping shape climate- resilient cities.
 
IX.	PROJECT DOMAIN
The suggested project works at the intersection of a number of major fields:
Internet of Things (IoT): Utilizing networked devices to gather and send environmental information in real-time [1].
Urban Microclimate Monitoring: Monitoring and study- ing small-scale climatic fluctuations in urban areas to compre- hend phenomena such as the Urban Heat Island effect [3].
Environmental Sensing: Using sensors to monitor param- eters like temperature, humidity, and air quality [7].
Climate Adaptation and Smart Cities: Deploying data- informed approaches for increasing urban resilience and sus- tainability under climate change [4].
By synthesizing these fields, the project will create a holistic solution for real-time monitoring of urban microclimate and climate-adaptive decision support.
X.	ALIGNMENT WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
GOALS (SDGS)
The suggested IoT-boosted web platform for real-time urban microclimate monitoring and climate-resilient decision support is in line with a number of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
Urban microclimate monitoring can enhance public health by detecting areas with bad air quality or extreme temperatures, thus allowing for targeted interventions to safeguard vulnerable groups. [1]
SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities The use of smart technologies, including IoT-based environmental mon- itoring, helps in the creation of sustainable cities through increased efficiency and resilience of infrastructure. [4]
SDG 13: Climate Action Real-time urban microclimate data enables knowledge-based decision-making for climate adaptation and mitigation policies, aiding responses to climate change. [1]
XI.	RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Here, we report the results from our simulated sensor data and discuss their relevance to monitoring Chennai’s urban microclimate and other urban areas in Tamil Nadu. The discussion is structured into various subsections to clearly articulate performance measures, environmental effects, and implications for urban planning and policy.
A.	Simulated Sensor Data Results
Applying past climate information provided by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the appropriate climate projections [13], [14], we derived simulated sensor observa- tions for significant environmental parameters. Simulation was directed to three major indicators: temperature, humidity, and air quality.
Temperature: The simulation shows that in summer months, average daytime temperatures in city Chennai go up to 38○C, whereas the rural areas are at about 34○C. This indicates
 
a UHI effect of about 4○C, which is also confirmed from previous studies [13], [15].
Humidity: Simulated data indicate that relative humidity in urban regions is marginally lower than in rural areas. This variation is due to less vegetation and more impervious surfaces in highly developed environments.
Air Quality: Forecasted sensor values reveal that urban re- gions in Chennai have higher concentrations of air pollutants, including PM2.5 and PM10. The high levels are probably due to more vehicle emissions and industrial processes.

B.	Performance Evaluation
The simulated results were compared against various per- formance measures:
Data Accuracy: The simulated sensor data are in close agreement with the anticipated trends from historical and forecast data, indicating that the selected simulation approach is appropriate.
Real-Time Data Processing: The system is shown to process and display data in real time, enabling actionable intelligence for stakeholders.
System Scalability: The modular nature of the system design facilitates scalable deployment in various urban mi- croenvironments.

C.	Environmental Impact Analysis
The simulation outcomes offer insights into the local envi- ronmental effects:
Urban Heat Island (UHI) Effect: The temperature differ- ences observed validate the occurrence of a substantial UHI effect in Chennai, which can amplify energy demands and adversely affect public health. .
Air Quality Degradation: Elevated pollutant levels in cities underscore the need for air quality monitoring to reduce health impacts and guide regulatory policy. Microclimate Variability: Differences in temperature and humidity between urban and rural areas underscore the necessity of localized climate information to create effective mitigation strategies.

D.	Implications for Urban Planning and Policy
The simulated sensor data have various implications for policymakers and urban planners:
Green Infrastructure: The findings indicate that increasing the size of urban green spaces like parks, green roofs, and street trees can mitigate the UHI effect as well as air quality overall. Reflective Materials: Using high-albedo materials in urban development can reduce heat absorption and lower the ambient temperature. Sustainable Transportation: En- couraging public transport, cycling, and pedestrian routes can decrease vehicular emissions, thus enhancing urban air quality. Data-Driven Decision Making: Access to real-time microclimate data can enable urban planners and policymakers to make informed decisions, personalize energy policies, and increase the overall sustainability of cities.
 
E.	Comparative Discussion
Comparing our proposed system with existing IoT-based microclimate monitoring solutions reveals several strengths:
Our system achieves a balance between cost-effectiveness and performance, using low-cost sensors while delivering high-resolution data. The real-time processing capability and scalable architecture support widespread deployment, unlike some existing systems that are limited to niche applications. The easy-to-use web interface adds to the accessibility, which simplifies non-technical stakeholders’ ability to understand the data and make informed decisions.
Overall, the simulated results, when combined with the design of the proposed system, show its capability to enhance urban microclimate monitoring and facilitate efficient, data- based urban planning for Tamil Nadu.
XII.	CONCLUSION
Low-cost, IoT-based urban microclimate monitoring sys- tems have proved to hold substantial promise in revealing more about the dynamics of the environment in cities. Research has indicated that they are able to accurately capture the spatial and temporal patterns in microclimatic parameters and provide useful data for urban planning and public health projects [2]. Coupling real-time data processing and visualization platforms further enables stakeholders to make well-informed decisions for countering detrimental effects of urbanization, including the Urban Heat Island effect [4]. Additionally, the afford- ability and availability of these technologies allow them to be deployed in economically disadvantaged areas, enabling wider participation in environmental monitoring activities [5]. Despite this, there are issues with maintaining data accuracy, durability of sensors, and network stability. Addressing these issues through ongoing research and development is crucial for maximizing the efficacy of IoT-based microclimate monitoring systems in fostering sustainable urban environments.
